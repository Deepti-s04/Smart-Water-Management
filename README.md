# Smart-Water-Management
This project is a smart water management system designed to efficiently monitor and control water levels in tanks. It uses sensors and Arduino-based hardware to detect reserve and overflow levels, provides real-time visual alerts through LEDs, and employs a transistor-switch mechanism for energy efficiency.

The system is being expanded to:

Connect with a web-based dashboard/website for real-time notifications, live tank status display, and automatic motor control.

Implement a machine learning model to predict future water usage patterns based on historical and real-time data.

The goal is to create a smart, sustainable, and user-friendly water management solution blending IoT, embedded systems, and AI.
